This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# MagicLab test

I enjoyed the excercise, found it quite interesting and I think it tests the understanding of crucial front-end development elements:
- asynchronous operations
- component composition
- handling errors
- markup
- React basics
- choosing the right tools for the job: I chose to go with `create-react-app` since it gives the basic setup and file organisation pattern that I find sufficient for a small project like this. Since the task was to refresh a live feed I went with full-client side approach. For mainly server-side based task, I'd use `next`.

What it's missing is testing.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
